    Mentor Match was the idea for the <a href = "http://ladyproblemshackathon.com/">Lady Problems Hackathon</a> in LA in December 2016. The purpose of Mentor Match is to create mentor-mentee relationships for women in software development. We want to increase interest, confidence, and retention of women in computer science by making long-term connections with real, experienced women in the industry.

  <p>Take a look at some of the awesome <a href = "/mprofiles">mentors</a> that are partnering with us and make sure you <a href= "/users/sign_up">sign up</a> and <a href="/users/sign_in">sign in</a> if you're interested in connecting with them.
  <p>
    If you'd like to be a mentor, feel free to <a href="/users/sign_up">sign up</a> and <a href="instructor/mprofiles/new">create a profile</a>. We're actively looking for more mentors of all experience levels.
