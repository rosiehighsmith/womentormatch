    Mentor Match was the idea for the <a href = "http://ladyproblemshackathon.com/">Lady Problems Hackathon</a> in LA in December 2016. The purpose of Mentor Match is to create mentor-mentee connections for women in software development. We want to increase interest, confidence, and retention of women in computer science.
